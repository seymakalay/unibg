### Premise

A super-nice feature of R markdown files is the ability to run code chunks and use their output. BUT you are not limited to R in the code chunks. You can run a [wide variety](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/) of existing languages and can [add your own](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/knitrengines) pretty easily. 

I posited that one could use a single knitr Rmd document to incorporate all the steps for a reproducible research product across multiple languages (say, if you need/want to use `perl` or `awk` for data munging and need to use something that's in `scikit-learn` that's not in R).

This document is a small example of how to incorporate a multi-language/engine workflow into a single Rmd document. 

### Starting the workflow

I don't have a really ugly file to work with at the moment (at least that I can share) so here's a totally made up example of grabbing a file from the web (found at random), doing some munging and then reading it into R for some work and then using (ugh) `gnuplot` to visualize the results.

Note that "state" is not maintained in anything but R code chunks in an Rmd so everything else relies on using files (or other techniques) to ensure that you have what's needed between processing steps.

We'll need some setup code since I'm using `gnuplot`:

```{r}
library(knitrengines) # github.com/hrbrmstr/knitrengines
```

Let's fetch the data file we'll be working on (using `bash`).

<pre>
&#96;``{r "get data file", engine="bash"}
curl --silent --output goodreads.csv "https://www.gwern.net/docs/personal/goodreads.csv"
> goodreads_cleaned.csv
&#96;``
</pre>

```{r "get data file", engine="bash", echo=FALSE}
curl --silent --output goodreads.csv "https://www.gwern.net/docs/personal/goodreads.csv"
> goodreads_cleaned.csv
```

That file has a field with HTML tags in it, so let's get rid of them. Note that we pass the input filename to `awk` in the `engine.opts` field.

<pre>
&#96;``{r "fix data file", engine="awk", engine.opts="goodreads.csv"}
{
  gsub(/<[^>]*>/,"")
  print >> "goodreads_cleaned.csv"
}
&#96;``
</pre>

```{r "fix data file", engine="awk", engine.opts="goodreads.csv", echo=FALSE}
{
  gsub(/<[^>]*>/,"")
  print >> "goodreads_cleaned.csv"
}
```

Now use R to do some hardcore stats work:

<pre>
&#96;``{r "process file"}
goodreads <- read.csv("goodreads_cleaned.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
ratings_count <- table(goodreads$My.Rating)
write.table(as.data.frame(ratings_count), "goodreads_ratings.dat", col.names=FALSE, sep=" ", quote=FALSE)
&#96;``
</pre>

```{r "process file", echo=FALSE}
goodreads <- read.csv("goodreads_cleaned.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
ratings_count <- table(goodreads$My.Rating)
write.table(as.data.frame(ratings_count), "goodreads_ratings.dat", col.names=FALSE, sep=" ", quote=FALSE)
```

And, then use gnuplot to generate some cutting edge visualizations:

<pre>
&#96;``{r "plot me", engine="gnuplot"}
set terminal png 
set output "goodreads.png"
set style fill solid
set boxwidth 0.5
plot "goodreads_ratings.dat" using 1:3:xtic(2) with boxe
&#96;``
</pre>

```{r "plot me", engine="gnuplot", echo=FALSE}
set terminal png 
set output "goodreads.png"
set style fill solid
set boxwidth 0.5
plot "goodreads_ratings.dat" using 1:3:xtic(2) with boxes
```

![](goodreads.png)


Note that we had to use to get that image into the Rmd.
