# **About Me**

I am a current PhD student in Applied Economics and Management (AEM) at the [UNIBG](https://www.unibg.it/node/9405en/people/phd-students) & [UNIPV](https://sites.google.com/unipv.it/phd-aem/home-page/people/students) in Italy.
I like doing [applications](https://github.com/seymakalay), biking, cooking for family & friends, woodworking, and gardening the most.

## My Tutors

During my PhD, I have been thankful for each of my companions and professors whom I learn and improve a lot. 
Especially, I am personally thankful to the head of the department 
[Prof. Gianmaria Martini](https://didattica-rubrica.unibg.it/ugov/person/2189), 
and my supervisors 
[Prof. Michela Cameletti](https://didattica-rubrica.unibg.it/ugov/person/2441) and
[Prof. Federica Maria Orgio](https://didattica-rubrica.unibg.it/ugov/person/3333).
